# Week 3 Projects - CSS

#### Instructions: Your task is to re-create from scratch the websites that you see from the screenshots. Each project is it’s own individual website which may have one or more pages. Detailed instructions for each project are listed below. Good luck!

### Project #1: The buttons

In this project, your goal is to create create four buttons that will be blue, red, green and yellow.
 
The blue button has color of 0D47A1, the red button has a color of F44336, the green button has a color of 4CAF50, and the yellow button has a color of FFEB3B.
 
### Project #2: Fruit Gallery

You are given 9 images and you must create a simple image gallery. Easy, right? Well, the challenge here is that the image gallery must be responsive- meaning it resizes itself when the browser window gets smaller.
 
* This is how the image gallery should look on a full size browser on a laptop: https://i.imgtc.com/AgBa9pm.png
 
* This is how the image gallery should look on a medium size browser on a tablet: https://i.imgtc.com/eK6AhTx.png
 
* This is how the image gallery should look on a small size browser on a phone: https://i.imgtc.com/QGRguil.png
 
Hint: Use flexbox.



### Project #3: Navigation Bars

#### For this project we are going to build out a navigation bar like the ones you would common see at the top of most websites.

The navigation bar should:

1. Have 5 top menu items: Home, About, Locations, FAQ and Contact.
2. Hovering over ‘About’ should bring a dropdown menu that gives links to ‘Bio’ and ‘Portfolio’.
3. Hovering over Locations should bring a dropdown menu that gives links to Austin, ‘Houston’, ‘Dallas’, and ‘San Antonio’.
4. Hovering over ‘FAQ’ should bring a dropdown menu that gives links to Why do business with us and Our Partners’.
5. Hovering over ‘Contact’ should bring a dropdown menu that gives links to ‘Phone’ and ‘Email us’.
6. The top menu bars should have a dark blue color (#01579B).
7. When you hover over a top menu item, it should change to a light blue color (#9AD1E3).
8. When you hover over a submenu item, it should change to a light green color (#ACE39A).
9. The body of the webpage should have a light gray color (#ECEFF1).
10. The menu blocks should have a height of 70px and a width of 300px.
11. You should Google Fonts and have the font ‘Oswald’.

Hints:

* Your HTML will have a list within a list.
* You’ll want to remove any default styling from the lists.
* You will need to use display: block.
* You will need to use the CSS hover selector.
* You will need to use floats.

Final note: With CSS selectors, there are multiple ways of selecting things. You can achieve the same effects by doing things differently. But remember that you don’t necessarily need to create multiple classes and ID’s for everything that you want to select. For example, try selecting specific list items with “li ul li”, and links within those list items with “li ul li a”.


### Project #4: The News

Ready for the big one? Here we go.

#### In this project, you’ll build the front page of a website complete with a navigation bar and footer.

The body of the page should:

* Have the font ‘Oswald’ from Google Fonts have the background color of #eaf0f2

The navbar should:

* Under ‘Tech’, it should have a dropdown menu with Latest, Programming, and App Reviews
*  Under ‘Politics’, it should have a dropdown menu with Headlines, The Facts, and The Gossip
* Under ‘About’, it should have a dropdown menu with Our Story and Donate

The logo should:

* Be 42px and have top and bottom padding of 15px, and left and right padding of 35px, and a line height of 35px.

The dropdown menu items in the navigation bar should:

* Have a height of 45px
